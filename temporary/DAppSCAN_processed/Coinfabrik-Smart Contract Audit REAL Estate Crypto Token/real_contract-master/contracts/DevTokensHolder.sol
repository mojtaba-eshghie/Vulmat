    // Right now, Solidity does not support decimal numbers. (This will change very soon)

    //  expressing the percentage in "x per 10**18"
    // This format has a precision of 16 digits for a percent.
    // Examples:
    //  3%   =   3*(10**16)
    //  100% = 100*(10**16) = 10**18
    //
    // To get a percentage of a value we do it by first multiplying it by the percentage in  (x per 10^18)
    //  and then divide it by 10**18
    //
    //              Y * X(in x per 10**18)
    //  X% of Y = -------------------------
    //               100(in x per 10**18)
